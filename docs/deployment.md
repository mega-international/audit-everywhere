# Deploy and configure of **Audit Everywhere** from a Zip file

## Pre Requisite

To deploy and use Audit Everywhere you need:

- HOPEX V3 CP4 minimum
- Install **HOPEX Graphql**. You can download it from [HOPEX store](https://community.mega.com/t5/HOPEX-Store/GraphQL-REST-API/td-p/21381).
- **HTTPS** is mandatory since **Audit Everywhere** is a [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-progressive-web-app-architectures).
- [URL Rewrite](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite)  Extension for IIS
- Browser minimum version [please check](https://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers)

## Deploy on IIS

> **:exclamation: Caution**
>
> The url of the application should end with **audit-everywhere**
>

Copy the content of the `Zip file` to `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\audit-everywhere`

## Configuration file

Create the application configuration file **config.json**. Copy `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\audit-everywhere\config\config.json.example` to `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\audit-everywhere\config\config.json`

- Set **ROOT_API** to the root url of HOPEX no leading HOPEX no leading **/**. For instance `https://myHopexRootURL.mycompany.com` will be the **ROOT_API** if  `https://myHopexRootURL.mycompany.com/hopex` is the URL of HOPEX.
- The **environmentId** is the absolute identifier of the production environment you can get it form the megasite.ini and convert it.
- The **repositoryId** is the absolute identifier of the repository you can get it form the megaenv.ini and convert it.
- The **profileId** is the absolute identifier of a profile. The default value **tWisjijuFnES** is the absolute identifier of the profile **Auditor**.
- Set the **client_secret** according HOPEX configuration.
- The **validatedStatus** defines the list of statuses of a read only activity, each status being separated by the character '|'. If you change the list, do not forget to add **localyvalidated** status given by the application when tap on complete activity.
- The **unvalidatedStatus** defines the list of the statuses of an editable activity, each status being separated by the character '|'.
- The **connectivity url** can be set to `https://myHopexRootURL.mycompany.com/audit-everywhere/img/px.gif` to avoid cross-site warning, if `https://myHopexRootURL.mycompany.com` is the ROOT_API.

## Configuration for HOPEX V3

As a reminder Audit everywhere is compatible since HOPEX V3CP4. For HOPEX V3 versions there is more recommendation:

- Set up a separate server for GraphQL
- The HOPEX environment must be defined as a shared folder  `\\mySrv\myShare\myEnvironment`

### External ID Permission

For HOPEX versions earlier than v4, a manual step is required to edit the user rights with respect to a field used by the API: externalID.
The edit consists in assigning full rights to all user profiles on this attribute. To do so, you must login into HOPEX via the HOPEX Administrator profile:

1. Select "Permissions â€“ Object UI Access"
1. Under "Access Rights", select the profile **`<HOPEX Default>`**
1. Under "MetaModel", select **`<All>`**
1. Under "MetaClass" select the button "Abstract MetaClasses" and then the object "Generic Object"
1. On the list on the right-hand side which appears, find the object "External Identifier", double click on the column "Permission" and write "RU".
1. Logout and Save all changes

### GraphQL Server Set Up

A separate backend has to be set up. It will be named GraphQLServer further in this article. It will have as url: `https://GraphQLserver.mycompany.com`. It contains:

- SSP
- UAS
- HOPEX Back-end
- HOPEX GraphQL
  
### GraphQL Server Config

 Set up MTA in the megasite.ini on this specific machine.

```ini
[System]
SPROCoThreadModel=2

[Debug]
LogSPROCoThreadModel=1
LogCoThreadModel=1

[Environment Shortcuts]
yyyyyyyyyyyy=\\mySrv\myShare\myEnvironment
```

### GraphQL Server CORS Configuration

Specific cross-site scripting configuration for GraphQLServer server

- For UAS Web.config

```xml
 <customHeaders>
    <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value="https://myHopexRootURL.mycompany.com" />
    <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Headers" value="Content-Type, Authorization, HopexContext" />
    <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Methods" value="GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS" />
    <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" value="true" />
</customHeaders>
```

- For HOPEXGraphQL Web.config

```xml
<customHeaders>
    <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value="hhttps://myHopexRootURL.mycompany.com" />
    <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Headers" value="Content-Type, Authorization, X-Hopex-Context, x-hopex-sessiontoken, x-hopex-task, x-hopex-wait" />
    <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Methods" value="GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS" />
    <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" value="true" />
</customHeaders>
```

### Install Audit-everywhere

Install Audit-everywhere on the regular HOPEX front end server (url: https://myHopexRootURL.mycompany.com).

Here are the values to be used for the configuration file config.json:
- **ROOT_API** has to be set to  `https://GraphQLServer.mycompagy.com`
- **environmentId** has to be set to `yyyyyyyyyyyy`
- **connectivity url** has to be set to `https://myHopexRootURL.mycompany.com/audit-everywhere/img/px.gif`
